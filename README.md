👋  My name is Carlo!

I make infrastructure in the cloud that other people build great things on. <sup>[[1]](https://www.hackerone.com) [[2]](https://www.billgo.com)</sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.nationbuilder.com)

I write about things that I find interesting at [carlo.cloud](https://www.carlo.cloud). Some topics that I have written about are topics such as multi-region cloud journeys, infrastructure modernization, and cost optimization.

While I do infrastructure engineering day-to-day, I have experience with:
* ⚙️ Systems Engineering
* 🔒 Security Engineering
* 🌐  Network Engineering
* 🥼  Data Science

I'd love to hear from you! [me@carlo.cloud](mailto:me@carlo.cloud)
